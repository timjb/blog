title: A Survey of Phrase Projectivity in the <em>Antigone</em>
---

In this [paper](/pdfs/Antigone-Projectivity.pdf), I demonstrate how, and
to what degree, phrase projectivity corresponds with register and meter
in Sophocles's *Antigone*, by developing a quantitative metric $\wp$ for
projectivity and comparing it across lyrics, trimeters and anapaests
using the data provided by the [Perseus Ancient Greek Dependency
Treebank](http://nlp.perseus.tufts.edu/syntax/treebank/greek.html). In
the appendices, the formal algorithm for the computations done herein is
developed in Haskell.
