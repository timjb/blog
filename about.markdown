Software engineer, dilettante type theorist, syntactician, and
philologist. Student of Ancient Greek, Sumerian, Hittite, Akkadian,
Latin, Old English and German.

I'm currently banging my head against a combinatory categorial grammar
model for Ancient Greek, which will help us generate word order for
Greek compositionally with minimal incidental structure.
