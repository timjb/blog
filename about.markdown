I'm currently banging my head against a combinatory categorial grammar
model for Ancient Greek, which will help us generate word order for
Greek compositionally with minimal incidental structure. My more
ambitious goal is to demonstrate a clear distinction between lexically
mandated **intrinsic structure**, and the **incidental structure** which
arises from an inexpressive theory.
